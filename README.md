# HiKingsRome  
*Nearby Rome, nature awaits!*

Welcome to HiKingsRome, where technology meets trails! This is the home of all the scripts, tools, and quirky code powering our hiking group in and around Rome. Whether it’s managing participant lists, automating reminders, or keeping track of the best routes, this repository has it covered.

🌟 What Is HiKingsRome?  
HiKingsRome is all about helping people escape the city, connect with nature, and enjoy the beautiful landscapes around Rome. To make organizing these adventures smoother, I've built a collection of scripts and tools that do everything from managing Google Sheets to automating tasks with Hiky, our friendly bot.

🛠️ What’s in This Repository?  
This repo is a mix of scripts, code, and general chaos (but the good kind). Here's what you'll find:

- Google Sheets Automations ✨ [Deprecated]  
A collection of scripts to manage participant data, hike schedules, and all the logistics that keep HiKingsRome running.

- Hiky the Bot 🤖  
Our trusty assistant who:
  - **Event Registration** - Allows users to sign up for hiking events with personal information, equipment status, and location details.
  - **Hike Calendar** - Displays upcoming hikes with relevant information such as difficulty, available spots, and dates.
  - **Profile Management** - Users can create and manage their personal profiles with contact information, preferences, and privacy settings.
  - **Weather Forecasts** - Provides weather information for upcoming hikes based on location coordinates.
  - **Admin Tools** - Enables administrators to create, edit, and manage hiking events, including participant tracking.
  - **Maintenance Scheduling** - Allows administrators to schedule and notify users about bot maintenance periods.
  - **Reminder System** - Sends automated reminders to participants before hikes (5 days and/or 2 days before events).
  - **Car Sharing Coordination** - Facilitates car sharing between participants based on their locations and preferences.
  - **Donation Support** - Offers methods for users to financially support the hiking group's activities.
  - **Group Membership Verification** - Ensures only registered community members can access the bot's functionality.

- Other Tools and Scripts 🛠️  
Anything else that helps us organize hikes, stay connected, and make HiKingsRome more efficient.

🤷‍♂️ Why Did I Build This?  
Because organizing a hiking group can be more exhausting than climbing a mountain! With HiKingsRome, I wanted to combine my love for nature with a bit of tech to make things easier for everyone.

Also, let’s be clear: I’m not a professional programmer. These scripts were cobbled together with the help of AI (shoutout to [Claude](https://claude.ai/)!) and a whole lot of trial and error. So if you spot some messy code, remember—I’m better at picking hiking trails than writing elegant algorithms.

🖇️ Contributing  
Feel free to explore, laugh at the code, and contribute if you’d like! Whether you’re here to improve a script, fix a bug, or just get inspired for your own hiking group, you’re welcome to join the journey!
